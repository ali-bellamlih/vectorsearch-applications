       "(\"digest everything that I've read now, I'm really struck by the idea that if we're evolving culturally, we need to be certain that we're not limiting ourselves based on previously held beliefs. So when I think about this, if there is something that could be designed into the system that would allow people to be more loosely connected, where they would have access to information that's otherwise quite difficult to come by, and that would lead to faster growth and development, if you're growing and evolving at a faster rate, rates of self-evolution, you're more likely to be able to solve problems. So I think consumer capitalism, and I'm going to speak pretty roughly here, but it fixates people on things that are, they're not purpose built to solve. So the reason that I think is this immersion in consumer capitalism is leading people away from their sense of purpose, and it's making them less happy, and it's putting them into a position where they're less capable of solving problems. So when I think about all of this, and I think about my goal, which is to hopefully contribute to human cooperation and solving the world's biggest problems, it's so interesting to me to think that if the things that you're talking about are true, and there is a way to design that in, that would be absolutely extraordinary. Now, I'm not saying that's true, but if it is, that could be extraordinary. And it would help us solve all of these big problems that otherwise seem to be quite intractable. So, I don't know. I'm definitely going to look further into all of this. Vishen, thank you so much for coming on the show. I know we didn't get to talk about a weighty of things, but this, I think, was really interesting. I'm going to encourage everybody listening to take a really deep dive into this, especially if there's information that could make you more capable of solving the world's biggest problems. That just seems absolutely extraordinary. So, Vishen, thank you so much for coming on the show. And guys, definitely take a look at the show notes. I'm going to be listing all of the books and everything that Vishen and I discussed so that you guys can do a deep dive. So, Vishen, thank you again for coming on the show.

      "SUMMARY: In this episode of Impact Theory, host Tom Bilyeu interviews Dr. Moriel Zelikowsky, an assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of Utah. Dr. Zelikowsky's research focuses on neural circuits involved in emotion, particularly social isolation. She explains that she was drawn to the science of emotion because of its clinical relevance and the potential to find cures or treatments for various conditions. She initially studied fear and memory, exploring how traumatic experiences are stored in memory and affect future interactions. Dr. Zelikowsky's current work involves studying the effects of social isolation on the brain and behavior of mice. She explains that mice are highly social animals, and isolation for an extended period of time leads to increased aggression, persistent fear responses, and difficulties in mating and social interactions. Dr. Zelikowsky's lab is particularly interested in the neuropeptide tachykinin-2, which is upregulated in the brain following social isolation. This neuropeptide plays a role in coordinating the brain's response to isolation, but its exact function and effects are still being studied. The duration of isolation required to observe these effects in mice is about two weeks, but it is unclear how long it takes for similar effects to manifest in humans. Dr. Zelikowsky also discusses the potential impact of social media and the presence of a small support group on mitigating the effects of isolation. She emphasizes the importance of fear as an adaptive response, helping individuals recognize and respond to dangerous situations. However, excessive fear and anxiety can be detrimental, impairing decision-making and cognitive function. Dr. Zelikowsky explains that exposure therapy is a common treatment for PTSD and other anxiety disorders, involving the repeated exposure to traumatic cues or experiences in a controlled environment. Overall, the episode provides insights into the neuroscience of fear, the effects of social isolation, and potential therapeutic approaches for anxiety-related conditions.\n",

Instead, he suggests that becoming excellent at a skill and building mastery can lead to passion and fulfillment in one's career.

I got a car that's paid for and I got no curfew. And right out of that, I decided I'm going to go away to Australia to be an exchange student. It was Australia or Sweden. And I remember writing down my 18 year old mind, sunny beaches, Elle McPherson, English speaking, Australia. So I head off to Australia and I'm told by this family that I'm gonna live with we live here. It's a beautiful place. We live on the outskirts of Sydney. You're going to love it. Well, very quickly after I meet this family and three hour drive out of Sydney, which is a bit of an exaggeration of what the outskirts are.\",\n",

He advises against being too ambitious and emphasizes the importance of separating vision from goals. According to Lopez, having a massive vision can lead to burnout and discouragement if one tries to achieve it all at once. Instead, he recommends setting one-day goals and celebrating small victories along the way. This approach helps to build discipline and maintain motivation by providing a sense of progress and accomplishment.\n",

Peterson believes that understanding the evolutionary roots of kindness and personal responsibility is crucial for individuals to navigate and thrive in the world. By acknowledging the potential for violence within oneself and choosing to be kind, individuals can take on the responsibility of defending themselves while also promoting empathy and compassion.\n",

She emphasizes that in order to make positive changes in our lives, we need to stop waiting for motivation and instead take action, even when it feels uncomfortable or difficult.\n",

In other words, the likelihood that our evolution would lead to us having insight into the true structure of reality is extremely low. Hoffman suggests that while it is not impossible for this to happen, the probability is so low that one would bet against it. Therefore, he argues that our evolution does not provide us with insight into the structure of objective reality.\n",

Stephan suggests that when people meet in person, they don't have time to analyze every aspect of a person's appearance like they would on a dating app. Instead, they are more likely to connect based on attraction and chemistry. Therefore, Stephan believes that getting out and socializing in real-life settings can lead to better opportunities for men to meet women.\n",

This approach reduces the financial pressure and allows you to test and validate your business idea before fully committing to it. Additionally, starting a business on nights and weekends allows you to gain experience, build momentum, and establish a foundation for your business without risking everything. It provides a more sustainable and manageable path towards entrepreneurship.\n",

She was like, okay, you can die in a ditch here at the bottom. I am going to just keep climbing. The idea that she might continue without me, super motivating. I would also happen to be the beneficiary of someone who\\'s been here, serendipitously riding down on the gondola with us after the second ascent. Colin O\\'Brady happened to have just been walking up this hill. Though we had no concept of who he was as we were walking up the hill, we\\'re sitting in this gondola. He says, oh yeah, hey, my name\\'s Colin. Oh, cool, what do you do? I just walked across Antarctica unaided. I\\'m like, oh, are you a cyborg sent back from the future, or are you made of skin too? When I realized that this human, truly, has the same humanity as I do, was capable of spending 54 days of time pulling a sled, a switch went off. I was like, you know what?\\n\\n\\nShow Summary: In this episode, Tom Bilyeu interviews Colin O\\'Brady, an accomplished mountaineer and endurance athlete.

My competition is way more prepared than me. What did I get myself into? You called your project the impossible first. Duh. Like, I literally pick up the satellite phone to call Jenna, my wife. She knows, you know, and the details of the whole project plans. And she\\'s like, why are you calling me so soon? You just got out there. And I\\'m like, so, it seems like we named our project the right thing. It appears that it\\'s impossible. And she\\'s like, wait, what? And I was like, yeah, I can\\'t really pull the sled. So, to me, it\\'s that moment, and I think we have a lot of these moments, both in the, you know, large sense in this case, or many of millions ones throughout the day, small decisions of you get to choose how to act in that moment. What I realized is our minds are flooded with doubt. We\\'re flooded with fear. We\\'re flooded with setbacks, right? But in those moments, like, we actually get to choose.\\n\\n\\nShow Summary: In this episode, Tom Bilyeu interviews Colin O\\'Brady, an accomplished mountaineer and endurance athlete.

Proving the power of the human mind, however, just 18 months later, he won the largest triathlon in the US. So please, help me in welcoming the first person to snap from Mount Everest to an audience of 22 million people, one of the biggest badasses in the world of human achievement, Colin O\\'Brady. My man. What\\'s up, dude? Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, man. It\\'s great to be here. It\\'s fantastic to be here. What you\\'ve done is so insane, dude. And as somebody who, for a while, I bordered on omnisphobic of the cold. So the thought of walking across by myself in an area where you can throw boiling water into the air and watch it turn into ice. Yes, indeed. That\\'s insane, man.

That was really, really awesome, man. Yeah, I\\'ve never thought about it like that, but you\\'re right. Like, the sense of being alive, even in moments of pain, is far more interesting than the numbness of the middle. So that\\'s really rad. Tell people where they can find you and follow this crazy journey of yours. Instagram and social is kind of my main platform. This is my name, at Colin O\\'Brady, C-O-L-I-N-O-B-R-A-D-Y. I\\'m on there, pretty active. My website\\'s colinobrady.com. I have a book that\\'s going to come out early next year. So that\\'ll all be up on my Instagram and website and stuff like that. So check that out when it comes out in 2020, hopefully. And I\\'ve got some inklings about some other expeditions and things like that. Nothing ready to announce yet, but my next art pieces will be coming to life here at some point. So come say hi, come follow along.\\n\\n\\nShow Summary: In this episode, the guest, Tom Bilyeu, discusses the power of meditation and how it has transformed the lives of many successful individuals. He starts by explaining the concept of epigenetics, which suggests that our environment and lifestyle choices play a significant role in our health and well-being, rather than just our genes. He then shares the results of a study that measured gene expressions in people who practiced meditation for four days, showing positive changes in genes related to cancer suppression, neurogenesis, and stem cell repair. Another study measured telomeres, the shoestrings on the end of DNA that determine biological age, and found that regular meditation led to lengthening of telomeres, indicating a reversal of aging. \\n\\nTom Bilyeu, known for his honesty and transparency, discusses his own journey of personal growth and the techniques he uses to stay in touch with his true self. He emphasizes the importance of meditation in his life and how it helps him deconstruct his own toxic thoughts and behaviors. He practices Vipassana meditation, which involves focusing on the breath and detaching from thoughts, leading to a deeper understanding of the impermanent nature of reality. \\n\\nThe conversation then shifts to the guest\\'s experience of overcoming a stroke and the principles he applies from his book to rebuild himself. He talks about the need to overcome personal weaknesses and deficiencies and the importance of meditation in resetting the mind every day. He also mentions the concept of surrendering into one\\'s inner space and how it can be a more efficient approach than hustling and overworking. \\n\\nThe discussion continues with the guest explaining the benefits of meditation in developing awareness and getting out from under the control of emotions. He highlights the importance of aligning the logical and subliminal parts of the brain and how meditation helps in achieving that alignment. The guest also emphasizes the value of gratitude and thinking big in small places. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the episode emphasizes the transformative power of meditation and encourages listeners to make it a part of their daily lives. The guest believes that meditation is a critical performance tool that can help individuals tap into their intuition, align their thoughts and emotions, and ultimately achieve their goals.\\nShow Guest: Tom Bilyeu\\nTranscript: Colin O\\'Brady, world record-holding explorer and one of the world\\'s best endurance athletes. Molly Bloom, entrepreneur and best-selling author of Molly\\'s Game. Tim Story, top-rated life coach and motivational speaker. Ray Dalio, billionaire and entrepreneur. So get ready for the power of motivation with our first guest, the one and only Dr. Joe Dispenza. I\\'ve talked pretty profoundly about proteins and really at a deep level how we\\'re signaling to our genetics to create these kinds of changes. What does that actually look like? Well, epigenetics, epi means above the gene. Many years ago, after the DNA helix was discovered by Watson and Crick, they said the blueprints of life, all diseases are created from genes. It turns out less than 5%, more like 1% of people on the planet are born with a genetic condition like type 1 diabetes or Tay-Sachs disease or sickle cell anemia. The other 95% to 99% are created by lifestyle and by choices. You can take two identical twins, exact same genome. One dies at 51, the other one dies at 85.\\n\\n\\nShow Summary: In this episode, Tom Bilyeu interviews Colin O\\'Brady, an accomplished mountaineer and endurance athlete. O\\'Brady shares his incredible journey of setting world records, including crossing Antarctica solo and unaided.

What drives you? Why, like, so I get the, the move towards the going inward and, and having that relationship with yourself and beginning to discover that, but I think there are far, far, far easier ways to do it, certainly less dangerous. So, what is it that drives you?\\n\\n\\nShow Summary: In this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, the guest Trevor Moawad, a sought-after performance coach, discusses the power of negative thinking and the concept of neutral thinking. Moawad explains that negative thinking is more powerful than positive thinking, as negativity is four to seven times more powerful than positivity. He emphasizes the importance of not saying stupid things out loud, as verbalizing negativity increases the likelihood of negative outcomes. Moawad shares stories of individuals who predicted negative outcomes by verbalizing them, such as Bill Buckner\\'s infamous baseball blunder and Pistol Pete Maravich\\'s fear of dying at 40. He also highlights the impact of behavior and the need to shift from negative to neutral thinking. Neutral thinking involves truth-based thinking and focusing on behavior rather than feelings. Moawad encourages individuals to write down their goals and emphasizes the power of hope and the belief in influencing one\\'s future. He also discusses the illusion of choice and the importance of making conscious decisions about what not to do in order to improve one\\'s life. Overall, Moawad\\'s insights provide a fresh perspective on the role of thinking and behavior in achieving success.\\nShow Guest: Trevor Moawad\\nTranscript: And then I\\'ll have people say, well, what do you want me to lie? I\\'m not telling you to lie. I\\'m telling you that if you look at the information and you say, I don\\'t want to be here today. I hate this job. God dang. Or you look at Mohamed Sanu, they\\'re up 28-3 in the Super Bowl playing against Tom Brady. He looks at his friend and says, hey man, they still got Tom Brady on their side. There is no lead that\\'s safe. Well, fuck, why are you saying that? You know, and you\\'re almost predicting that that\\'s what\\'s going to happen. Now ultimately, not saying stupid things out loud is you have to create an alternative. So I started thinking about a car. If a car\\'s going backwards, it can\\'t automatically go forward. So it has to shift into neutral and then it stops. Then at that point, you can either go forward by changing your behavior or you can go backwards by doing the same stupid shit you were just doing. Neutral is truth-based thinking. What\\'s the truth? Okay?\\n\\n\\nShow Summary: In this episode, Tom Bilyeu interviews Colin O\\'Brady, an accomplished mountaineer and endurance athlete.
